# Dialog

A dialog is a focused interface element used to present important information or request user input in a way that temporarily steps outside the main flow of the page. It appears visually separated from other content—often centered or layered above the interface—to draw attention to a specific task, decision, or message.

Dialogs are typically used for actions that require clear acknowledgment or resolution, such as confirmations, alerts, form entry, or presenting additional details without navigating away from the current context. Because they momentarily shift the user’s focus, they help create clear, guided interactions where attention, intent, and clarity are essential.

A dialog fits this definition when it:

* Temporarily takes focus away from the surrounding interface
* Provides a clearly scoped interaction (e.g., confirming an action, filling out a small form, reading an important message)
* Is visually and behaviorally distinct, helping the user understand it requires attention
* Resolves into a single, clear outcome, such as “confirm,” “cancel,” or “close”

In short, dialogs are a structured way to interrupt gently, guide decisions, and support tasks that require a moment of dedicated attention.
